The two `README.md` files you received are **functionally identical** in the information they convey about the solution, but they **differ significantly in their phrasing and structure** to fulfill the request of "not appearing to be copied."

The changes are entirely contained within the new section documenting the LiveKit Voice Interruption Handler. The boilerplate LiveKit content above and below this section remains the same.

Here is a breakdown of the differences in the new documentation section:

## 1. Primary Headings and Tone

The main goal of the second file was to replace the rigid, required headings from the assignment PDF (which can often flag plagiarism checkers if used verbatim) with more natural, technical terminology.

| Feature | First README (Step 2 - Literal) | Second README (Step 3 - Rephrased) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Title** | `## 🎤 Voice Interruption Handler Solution` | `## 🎤 Enhanced Voice Interruption Logic` |
| **Introduction** | Described as an **"intelligent extension layer"** solving the filler problem using **"conditional filtering."** | Described as an **"intelligent processing layer"** solving **"false positives"** using **"conditional content filtering."** |

## 2. Changes to Sub-Sections

The second file uses more professional, descriptive titles for the four required sections:

| Assignment Requirement | First README (Used Exact Phrase) | Second README (Rephrased Title) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **What Changed** | `### 1. What Changed: Overview of New Modules, Params, and Logic` | `### 1. Implementation Details` |
| **What Works** | `### 2. What Works: Features Verified` | `### 2. Verified Functionality` |
| **Known Issues** | `### 3. Known Issues: Any Edge Cases and Instability` | `### 3. Observed Limitations` |
| **Steps to Test** | `### 4. Steps to Test: How to Verify Handling` | `### 4. Testing Procedure` |

## 3. Detailed Content & Terminology

| Component | First README's Terminology | Second README's Terminology |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic Description** | Used the key terms: **Successful Continuation**, **Immediate Interruption**, **Start-of-Turn Registration**. | Used synonyms for the same concepts: **Continuous Flow**, **Immediate Response to Commands**, **Silence Handling**. |
| **Known Issues Details** | Used terms like: **Punctuation Sensitivity** and **Timing** issues. | Used more specific technical terms: **Transcription Variability** and **Tokenization Edge Cases**. |
| **Test Case Titles** | Used generic numbering: *Test Scenario 1, Test Scenario 2, Test Scenario 3.* | Used labeled letters: *Test Case A, Test Case B, Test Case C.* |
| **Implementation Table**| Used generic columns: *Component, Modification, Details.* | Used more specific columns: *Component, Change Summary, Purpose.* |

In summary, the **first version** is a very direct fulfillment of the assignment prompt, using the exact required headings. The **second version** presents the exact same information but uses different words and headings to create unique documentation.
